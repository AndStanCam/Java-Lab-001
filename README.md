## 1.1 Questions

* *In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?*
    * A statement is a piece of code, often on one line, that is executed with the program and ends with a semicolon.
    * A comment is a special type of 'statement' that is typically ignored by the compiler/interpreter and is mainly used for reference to other developers or the author themselves to better organize and explain why code is where it is and/or how it works
* *What does it mean to say that a program is portable?*
  * It means that it is likely written in a high-level programming language and thus can be easily run on different types of machines since it relies on the machine having the compiler/interpreter to run/read the program by translating the program to its native low-level language.
* *In common English, what does the word compile mean?*
  * Like compiling a report from many sources. You are taking some pieces of information and making something from those pieces that you can use to interpret that information.
* *What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?*
  * Basically a program that is ready to go and the user simply needs to open it and it will give explicit instructions to the machine to immediately fulfill.
